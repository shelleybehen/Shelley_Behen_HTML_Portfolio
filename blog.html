                <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to attend session 3 in person as I was having my broken nose reset.
                    Luckily, the slides and files are all available on line, so I was able to catch up once I had 
                    started to recover from my operation.</p>
                    <p>Session 3 was all about how to create a form on your website to collect information.  
                    We also learned how to create a responsive website, that will adjust to different screen sizes.  
                    Even though I missed the in person class, I was still able to complete all of the challneges and exercises which was good!</p>

                <h2>She Codes Plus, Session 2</h2>
                <h3>19<sup>th</sup>June, 2021</h3>
                <p>I was coming in to the Saturday session pretty confident.  I had gone back over the Session 1 slides and completed all my challenges.
                    That was my first mistake....for some reason, no matter what I was trying, I could not get my webpage to change like Caitlin's was.</p>
                <p>I was getting super frustrated and telling myself it was a mistake to come and I wasn't smart enough to be here.  
                    I was madly trying to work out how I could disappear without anyone noticing.</p>
                    <p>Luckily for me, Lachlan one of the mentors, pointed out that I was in the wrong file!            
                    Miraculously, once I was using the correct file, everything was working as expected!</p>
                    <p>The rest of the session went seemlessly and I couldn't believe I had come so close to quitting.
                    As a lovely surprise at the end of our session, last year's She Coders came in to chat about their experience.
                    We were also treated to some delicious food!</p>

                <h2>She Codes Plus, Session 1</h2>
                <h3>15<sup>th</sup>June, 2021</h3>
                <p>Well, here we are...To say I am terrified is an understatement.  
                    I can't believe that at 42 years of age I am finally going to learn how to code.
                    I need not have worried.  When I arrived at The Hub, Holly was waiting there to greet us all and escort us all up to our floor.  
                    After an icebreaker exercise to get to know each other, we all settled in to learn some HTML.</p>
                <p>Caitlin was our instructor, and she led us through the basic structure of creating a HTML document.  
                    It was so rewarding to see the webpage change each time we added code.  We then moved on to styling our document using CSS.
                    At this point I realised that developers are not just coders, they are actually artists.  
                    I personally think that the CSS applied to a webpage could be considered a form of self expression of the developer.</p>
                <p>A great time was had by all, and I can't wait to come back again on Saturday to learn more!</p></p>
